World Clock  

World Clock was created for an international learning environment where participants join from different time zones. The app helps users see what time it is for others in the group. Users can view a set of selected time zones that can be fully customised to their needs. In addition, World Clock can automatically display a local time based on the user’s estimated location anywhere in the world. This “current location” feature ensures that even users whose city is not yet listed in the app’s database can still use World Clock accurately.
